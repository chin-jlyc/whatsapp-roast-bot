# WhatsApp Business Idea Roast Bot - User Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up, using, and maintaining your WhatsApp bot that roasts business ideas using Google's Gemini AI.

## Overview

The WhatsApp Business Idea Roast Bot is a fun tool that listens to your WhatsApp group chats and roasts business ideas when mentioned. It uses:

- WhatsApp Web.js for WhatsApp integration
- Google's Gemini AI for generating witty roasts
- LocalAuth for persistent sessions

## Setup Instructions

### Local Setup (For Testing)

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js v18 or higher
   - A WhatsApp account
   - A Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/)

2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/whatsapp-roast-bot.git
   cd whatsapp-roast-bot
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your Gemini API key and bot settings:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     BOT_NAME=RoastBot
     BOT_TRIGGER=@RoastBot
     ```

4. **Running the Bot**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Authentication**:
   - A QR code will appear in the terminal
   - Open WhatsApp on your phone
   - Go to Settings > Linked Devices
   - Tap "Link a Device" and scan the QR code

### Production Deployment

For 24/7 operation, deploy the bot to Oracle Cloud Free Tier:

1. Follow the detailed instructions in [oracle-cloud-deployment.md](./oracle-cloud-deployment.md)
2. This provides a free, always-on server for your bot

## Using the Bot

Once the bot is running and authenticated:

1. **Add the Bot to Groups**:
   - The WhatsApp account you used to authenticate will be your bot
   - Add this account to any group chats where you want to use the bot

2. **Triggering the Bot**:
   - Mention the bot using its trigger word (default: `@RoastBot`)
   - Include a business idea in the same message
   - Example: `@RoastBot I want to create an app that delivers ice cream via drones`

3. **Bot Response**:
   - The bot will process the business idea
   - It will reply with a humorous roast generated by Gemini AI
   - The roast will be funny but not cruel

## Customization

### Changing the Bot Name and Trigger

Edit the `.env` file to change:
- `BOT_NAME`: The display name for your bot
- `BOT_TRIGGER`: The mention text that activates the bot

### Modifying the Roasting Style

To change how the bot roasts business ideas:
1. Open `src/gemini.js`
2. Find the prompt text in the `roastBusinessIdea` function
3. Modify the instructions to change the tone, style, or format of the roasts

### Adding New Features

The bot is built with a modular structure, making it easy to extend:
- Add new commands by modifying the message handler in `src/index.js`
- Integrate additional AI capabilities by expanding the Gemini integration

## Troubleshooting

### QR Code Issues
- If you can't scan the QR code, restart the bot with `npm start`
- Make sure your phone has a stable internet connection

### Authentication Problems
- If the bot disconnects frequently, delete the `.wwebjs_auth` directory and restart
- You'll need to scan the QR code again after deleting this directory

### Gemini API Issues
- Verify your API key is correct in the `.env` file
- Check the console logs for specific error messages
- Ensure you have sufficient quota in your Google AI Studio account

### Bot Not Responding
- Confirm the bot is running and shows "WhatsApp client is ready!"
- Verify you're using the correct trigger word
- Check if the WhatsApp account is properly connected

## Maintenance

### Keeping the Bot Running
- For local testing, the bot will run as long as your terminal is open
- For production, the PM2 process manager keeps it running on your server

### Updating the Bot
```bash
# Pull the latest changes
git pull

# Install any new dependencies
npm install

# Restart the bot
# For local: Ctrl+C to stop, then npm start
# For production: pm2 restart whatsapp-roast-bot
```

## Security Considerations

- Keep your Gemini API key secure
- Don't share your `.wwebjs_auth` directory
- Be mindful of WhatsApp's terms of service regarding bots
- Consider the privacy implications of adding the bot to group chats
